# Carshop Dev Test
An application, created using the following technologies:

* React - My preferred choice of front-end framework. The community is large and stable and the tools that are used in the React ecosystem are familiar to me.

* Node - The well known backend-end technology. I have integrated a small node app into this project for serving up the static assets required by the React application. Also contains a small API for making requests and returning data.

* Parceljs - A no-config bundler. I have not used this particular tool before, but decided that a small project like this would be the perfect opportunity to try it. [Docs can be found here](https://parceljs.org)

* React Router - Pretty much the industry standard for routing in React.

* CSS Modules - A fantastic tool for writing component CSS, ensuring that styles will never conflict. Each component is given a unique class name.

## How to get started

1) Pull the repo
2) `yarn/npm install` - I prefer yarn, due to it's speed. ðŸ”¥
3) `yarn start`
4) Check that the application is running. (Default port is `localhost: 3000)
5) Enjoy using the app! ðŸ˜Ž
